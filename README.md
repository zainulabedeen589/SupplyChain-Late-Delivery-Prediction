# 📌 Project Overview

Late deliveries are one of the biggest challenges in supply chain management. Delayed shipments increase operational costs, reduce customer satisfaction, and negatively impact business performance.

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether an order is likely to be delivered late based on historical supply chain data.

The project covers the complete Data Science lifecycle:

* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Machine Learning
* Model Evaluation
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model Deployment with Streamlit

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts the **Late Delivery Risk** of an order before shipment.

Target Variable:

```
Late_delivery_risk
```

Prediction Classes:

* 0 → On-Time Delivery
* 1 → Late Delivery

---

# 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains supply chain information including:

* Customer Information
* Product Information
* Order Details
* Shipping Details
* Department Information
* Region Information
* Delivery Status
* Shipping Mode
* Sales & Profit
* Delivery Risk
